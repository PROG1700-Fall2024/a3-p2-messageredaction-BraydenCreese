Program 2 – Message Redaction

Design and write a program that removes all desired letters from any user-entered sentence or phrase.
Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of how to apply list/loop concepts in a program that should:
•	Take a sentence or phrase as input,
•	Take a comma-separated list of letters to remove as input,
•	Replace all occurrences of each target letter in the user-entered sentence, regardless of case sensitivity, with an underscore (“_”) character.
•	Display the number of letters removed to the user,
•	The program will keep asking the user to enter a new sentence until the user enters the command ‘quit’.

Your solution must contain examples demonstrating your understanding of appropriate use of functions and core assignment concepts (loops and lists).
